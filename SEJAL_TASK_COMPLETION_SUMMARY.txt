SEJAL'S TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY
==============================

✅ TASK 1: Add Mini AI Judging Engine
-----------------------------------
File created: src/judging_engine.py
Features implemented:
- LLM-based evaluator (using OpenAI GPT-3.5)
- Rubric scoring (clarity, quality, innovation)
- Weighted average score calculation
- Confidence score
- Traceable reasoning output (InsightCore-compatible format)
- Fallback mechanism when API key is missing

✅ TASK 2: Add New Endpoint: /judge
----------------------------------
File created: src/routes/judge.py
Endpoint: POST /judge
Request format:
{
  "submission_text": "...",
  "team_id": "team_23"
}
Response format:
{
  "clarity": 22,
  "quality": 18,
  "innovation": 30,
  "total_score": 70,
  "confidence": 0.88,
  "trace": "reasoning text…",
  "team_id": "team_23"
}

✅ TASK 3: Integrate Judging Engine Into Existing Flow
----------------------------------------------------
Modified: src/routes/agent.py
- Added automatic judging evaluation after agent processing
- Store judge_score into MongoDB via bucket_connector
- Added KSML logging for judging evaluations
- Error handling for judging failures

✅ TASK 4: Quick Micro-Deployment
--------------------------------
Ready for deployment:
- Localhost UVicorn: uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8001
- All dependencies in requirements.txt (openai already included)
- Environment variable support (OPENAI_API_KEY)

✅ TASK 5: Provide Deliverables
------------------------------
1. Local URL: http://127.0.0.1:8001
2. Test payloads: test_judge_payload.json
3. Sample judged submission: sample_judged_submission.json
4. API documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs

ADDITIONAL FILES CREATED:
------------------------
- test_judging_engine.py - Standalone test for judging engine
- test_all_endpoints.py - Complete endpoint testing script
- YASH_INTEGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.txt - Instructions for Yash's frontend integration
- sample_judged_submission.json - Sample judged submission JSON
- test_judge_payload.json - Test payload for judge endpoint

VERIFICATION:
------------
- ✅ Judge endpoint returns correct response format
- ✅ Health endpoint working properly
- ✅ All existing endpoints still functional
- ✅ MongoDB integration working
- ✅ KSML logging implemented
- ✅ Fallback mechanism for missing API key

The AI Judging Engine is fully implemented and ready for Yash to integrate with his frontend UI.
