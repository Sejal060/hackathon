Reflection on Backend Handover Sprint
Learnings

API Design: I learned the importance of consistent JSON schemas using Pydantic, ensuring seamless integration with the frontend and storage layers.
Testing: Writing pytest cases taught me how to validate endpoints and achieve high coverage (90%), which boosted reliability.
Deployment: Setting up Render and understanding CI/CD workflows was a new challenge, highlighting the need for automation and environment management.
Modularity: Splitting logic into input_handler, reasoning, and executor modules made the codebase scalable and maintainable.

Challenges

Initially, endpoint tests failed due to mock issues, but debugging with stack traces and adjusting test logic resolved this.
Achieving 90% coverage required identifying and testing edge cases, which took time but paid off.

Gratitude

Thank you to the project head for the clear guidance and feedback.
Gratitude to Nipun, Akash, and Yash for their collaborationâ€”looking forward to seeing our integrated system live!
Special thanks to my mentors and peers for their support during this sprint.
