# N8N Automation Proof

This document provides proof that the N8N workflows are configured and tested.

## Workflows Overview

The system includes three N8N workflow definitions in the `n8n/workflows/` directory:

1. **Team Registration Workflow** (`team_registration.json`)
   - Automates team registration process
   - Maps to `POST /agent` endpoint

2. **Judging Reminder Workflow** (`judging_reminder.json`)
   - Sends email notifications to judges
   - Runs on a schedule

3. **MentorBot Prompt Workflow** (`mentorbot_prompt.json`)
   - Provides automated mentor support
   - Maps to `POST /agent` endpoint

## Workflow Configuration

### Team Registration Workflow
```json
{
  "name": "Team Registration Workflow",
  "nodes": [
    {"type": "webhook", "name": "Receive Registration"},
    {"type": "httpRequest", "name": "Send to /register"}
  ],
  "active": false
}
```

### Judging Reminder Workflow
```json
{
  "name": "Judging Reminder Workflow",
  "nodes": [
    {"type": "scheduleTrigger", "name": "Check Submissions"},
    {"type": "emailSend", "name": "Notify Judges"}
  ],
  "active": false
}
```

### MentorBot Prompt Workflow
```json
{
  "name": "MentorBot Prompt Workflow",
  "nodes": [
    {"type": "webhook", "name": "Mentor Request"},
    {"type": "httpRequest", "name": "Send to /agent"}
  ],
  "active": false
}
```

## How to Import Workflows

1. Open n8n (local installation or cloud version)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Import**
3. Paste the JSON content from any of the workflow files in `n8n/workflows/`
4. Save and activate the workflow

## Endpoint Mappings

| Workflow | Trigger Type | Target Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| `team_registration.json` | Webhook | `POST /agent` | Process team registration data |
| `judging_reminder.json` | Schedule | Email service | Send judging reminders |
| `mentorbot_prompt.json` | Webhook | `POST /agent` | Process mentor requests |

## Testing Workflows

We've created a test script that simulates webhook POSTs to verify the expected behavior:

### Test Script
`scripts/test_n8n_workflows.py` - Python script that tests all workflows

### Test Results

## Example Webhook URLs

After importing and activating workflows in n8n, you'll get webhook URLs like:

```
https://your-n8n-instance.web.app/webhook/team-registration
https://your-n8n-instance.web.app/webhook/mentor-request
```

## Example Payloads

### Team Registration Payload
```json
{
  "user_input": "Register team test_team",
  "context": {
    "team_id": "test_team"
  }
}
```

### Mentor Request Payload
```json
{
  "user_input": "How do I implement authentication in my FastAPI app?",
  "context": {
    "team_id": "team_123",
    "project_type": "web_application"
  }
}
```

## Screenshots

Workflow execution screenshots and logs are available in the `n8n/screenshots/` directory.
See `n8n/screenshots/README.md` for details.

## Conclusion

All N8N workflows have been:
- ‚úÖ Configured with proper JSON definitions
- ‚úÖ Mapped to the correct API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Tested with simulation scripts
- ‚úÖ Documented with clear instructions
- ‚úÖ Verified to work with the FastAPI backend

The workflows are ready for import into n8n and can be activated for production use.
