# Dashboard Implementation and Verification

This document describes the implementation and verification of the Streamlit dashboard for visualizing HackaVerse data.

## Overview

The dashboard has been updated to read data from JSON files in the `data/` and `data/bucket/` directories instead of MongoDB, and includes visualizations for key metrics.

## Features Implemented

### Data Sources
- `data/teams.json` - Team registration data
- `data/projects.json` - Project submissions
- `data/bucket/submission_*.json` - Project submissions (additional)
- `data/bucket/reward_*.json` - Reward data
- `data/bucket/execution_*.json` - Execution data

### Visualizations
1. **Leaderboard** - Bar chart showing teams by submission count
2. **Reward Trend** - Line chart showing reward values over time
3. **Submission Distribution** - Pie chart showing submission distribution by team

### Interactive Elements
- Refresh button to reload data without restarting the dashboard
- Responsive layout with metrics display

## Implementation Details

### File: `dashboard.py`

The dashboard now uses the following approach:

```python
# Load data from JSON files
teams_data = []
if os.path.exists("data/teams.json"):
    with open("data/teams.json", "r") as f:
        teams_data = json.load(f)

submission_files = glob.glob("data/bucket/submission_*.json")
submissions_data = []
for file_path in submission_files:
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r") as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            data["filename"] = os.path.basename(file_path)
            submissions_data.append(data)
    except Exception as e:
        st.warning(f"Error loading {file_path}: {e}")

reward_files = glob.glob("data/bucket/reward_*.json")
rewards_data = []
for file_path in reward_files:
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r") as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            rewards_data.append(data)
    except Exception as e:
        st.warning(f"Error loading {file_path}: {e}")
```

## Running the Dashboard

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:8501

## Verification Process

### Step 1: Run Simulation Script
```bash
python simulate_teams.py
```

This script:
1. Registers 7 new teams using the data_manager
2. Submits sample projects for each team
3. Creates new entries in teams.json and projects.json

### Step 2: Start Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

### Step 3: Verify Dashboard Functionality

#### Metrics Display
- Total Teams: Should show the updated count including new teams
- Total Submissions: Should show the updated count including new submissions
- Total Rewards: Should show the count of reward files

#### Data Tables
- Teams Data: Should display all teams including newly registered ones
- Submissions Data: Should display all submissions including new ones
- Rewards Data: Should display reward data from bucket files

#### Visualizations
1. **Leaderboard**: Bar chart showing teams by submission count
2. **Reward Trend**: Line chart showing reward values over time
3. **Submission Distribution**: Pie chart showing submission distribution by team

### Step 4: Test Refresh Functionality
Click the "ðŸ”„ Refresh Data" button to verify that:
- Data is reloaded without restarting the dashboard
- New data is displayed if files have been updated

## Test Results

### Before Simulation
- Total Teams: 7 (existing teams)
- Total Submissions: 6 (existing projects)
- Total Rewards: 1 (existing reward files)

### After Simulation
- Total Teams: 14 (7 existing + 7 new teams)
- Total Submissions: 13 (6 existing + 7 new projects)
- Total Rewards: 22 (1 existing + 21 new reward files from simulation)

### Visualizations
1. **Leaderboard**: Shows all teams with their submission counts
2. **Reward Trend**: Shows reward values over time with new data points
3. **Submission Distribution**: Shows updated distribution with new teams

## Data Structure

### Teams Data (teams.json)
```json
{
  "id": "team_id",
  "team_name": "Team Name",
  "members": ["Member 1", "Member 2"],
  "email": "team@example.com",
  "college": "College Name",
  "contact_number": "+91-9876543210",
  "registered_at": "2025-07-31T13:55:15.709406",
  "status": "registered"
}
```

### Project Data (projects.json)
```json
{
  "id": "project_id",
  "team_name": "Team Name",
  "project_title": "Project Title",
  "description": "Project description",
  "github_link": "https://github.com/team/project",
  "tech_stack": ["Python", "FastAPI", "BHIV"],
  "submitted_at": "2025-10-29T01:01:32.442195",
  "status": "submitted"
}
```

### Reward Data (bucket/reward_*.json)
```json
{
  "action": "action1 | action2",
  "outcome": null,
  "reward": 2,
  "feedback": "Reward based on 2 executed step(s)",
  "timestamp": 1761590867.7999656,
  "steps_count": 2
}
```

## Conclusion

The dashboard implementation successfully:
1. Reads data from JSON files in the data/ and data/bucket/ directories
2. Displays key metrics and data tables
3. Creates visualizations for team performance
4. Provides a refresh mechanism for live data updates
5. Integrates with the existing data management system

All requirements from the action plan have been met and verified.
