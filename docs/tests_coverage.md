## Test Results Summary

```
===== 44 passed in 257.83s (0:04:17) ======
```

All tests are passing successfully.

## CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml` includes:

1. Running all tests with coverage
2. Generating XML and HTML coverage reports
3. Uploading coverage reports as artifacts
4. Uploading screenshots as artifacts
5. Publishing coverage to Codecov (when configured)

## Areas for Improvement

### Low Coverage Components
1. **src/agent.py** - 0% coverage (24/24 lines missed)
2. **src/multi_agent.py** - 0% coverage (17/17 lines missed)

### High Coverage Components
1. **src/input_handler.py** - 100% coverage
2. **src/schemas.py** - 100% coverage
3. **src/integrations/__init__.py** - 100% coverage
4. **src/__init__.py** - 100% coverage
5. **src/integrations/bhiv_connectors.py** - 95% coverage
6. **src/transaction_manager.py** - 95% coverage
7. **src/reward.py** - 90% coverage
8. **src/main.py** - 93% coverage

10. **src/executor.py** - 82% coverage
11. **src/storage_service.py** - 86% coverage
12. **src/reasoning.py** - 77% coverage

## Future Work

To improve test coverage:

1. Add unit tests for the agent components
2. Add unit tests for multi-agent components
3. Add integration tests for API endpoints with mocked external services
4. Add end-to-end tests for complete workflows
5. Add performance tests for high-load scenarios

## Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in two formats:

1. **XML** - `coverage.xml` (for CI/CD integration)
2. **HTML** - `htmlcov/` directory (for detailed browser-based reporting)

To view the HTML coverage report:
```bash
# Open in browser (Windows)
start htmlcov/index.html

# Open in browser (Mac/Linux)
open htmlcov/index.html
```
