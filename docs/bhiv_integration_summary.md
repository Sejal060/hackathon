# BHIV Integration Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of BHIV Core and BHIV Bucket connectors for the HackaVerse API.

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Directory Structure

Created the following directory and files:
- `src/integrations/` - New directory for integration modules
- `src/integrations/__init__.py` - Package initialization file
- `src/integrations/bhiv_connectors.py` - Main connector implementation
- `scripts/test_bhiv_connectors.py` - Test script for verification

### 2. Environment Variables

Updated `.env.example` with new environment variables:
- `BHIV_BUCKET_DIR=./data/bucket` - Directory for local bucket storage

### 3. Connector Implementation

The `bhiv_connectors.py` file implements two main functions:

#### send_to_core(payload, max_retries=3, backoff=1)
- Sends payload data to BHIV Core via HTTP POST
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Logs failed attempts to `data/failed_core_sends.log`
- Uses environment variable `BHIV_CORE_URL` with default `http://localhost:9000/bhiv/core`

#### save_to_bucket(payload, filename)
- Saves payload data to local file storage (BHIV Bucket)
- Creates directory structure if it doesn't exist
- Uses environment variable `BHIV_BUCKET_DIR` with default `./data/bucket`

### 4. Integration Points

#### Executor Integration (`src/executor.py`)
- Integrated connectors into the `execute` method
- Sends execution results to both BHIV Core and BHIV Bucket
- Handles failures gracefully with logging

#### Reward System Integration (`src/reward.py`)
- Integrated connectors into the `calculate_reward` method
- Sends reward calculations to both BHIV Core and BHIV Bucket
- Handles failures gracefully with logging

### 5. Verification

Created comprehensive test script that verifies:
- ✅ `save_to_bucket` function correctly saves data to local storage
- ✅ Data integrity is maintained
- ✅ `send_to_core` function demonstrates retry logic
- ✅ Failed requests are properly logged to `data/failed_core_sends.log`
- ✅ All modules can be imported without errors

## Test Results

### Successful Operations
- ✅ Data saved to `data/bucket/test_execution_*.json`
- ✅ Data integrity verified
- ✅ Failed core sends logged to `data/failed_core_sends.log`

### Expected Behavior
- ❌ Connection failures to BHIV Core (expected when no service is running)
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging of failures
- ✅ Retry mechanism working correctly

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.integrations.bhiv_connectors import send_to_core, save_to_bucket

# Send data to BHIV Core
payload = {"team_id": "team_42", "action": "analyze_data"}
try:
    response = send_to_core(payload)
    print(f"Sent to core: {response}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to send to core: {e}")

# Save data to BHIV Bucket
filename = "team_42_analysis.json"
try:
    path = save_to_bucket(payload, filename)
    print(f"Saved to bucket: {path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to save to bucket: {e}")
```

### Integration in Executor
```python
# In src/executor.py
def execute(self, action: str) -> str:
    # ... execution logic ...
    
    # Send to BHIV Core and save to BHIV Bucket
    try:
        core_resp = send_to_core(payload)
        logger.info(f"Sent to BHIV Core: {core_resp}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to send to BHIV Core: {str(e)}")
    
    try:
        filename = f"execution_{int(time.time())}.json"
        bucket_path = save_to_bucket(payload, filename)
        logger.info(f"Saved to BHIV Bucket: {bucket_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to save to BHIV Bucket: {str(e)}")
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```
BHIV_CORE_URL=http://localhost:8002/reason    # BHIV Core endpoint
BHIV_BUCKET_DIR=./data/bucket                 # Local bucket storage directory
```

```

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `BHIV_CORE_URL` and `BHIV_BUCKET_DIR` are properly set in production environments
2. **Network Access**: BHIV Core must be accessible from the application server
3. **Directory Permissions**: Ensure the application has write permissions to the bucket directory
4. **Logging**: Monitor `data/failed_core_sends.log` for integration issues

## Future Improvements

1. **Authentication**: Add support for API keys or tokens for BHIV Core authentication
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement async versions of the connector functions
3. **Batch Operations**: Add support for batch sending to reduce network overhead
4. **Metrics Collection**: Add metrics for monitoring connector performance
