# OpenAPI Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the OpenAPI documentation requirements for the HackaVerse API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated src/main.py

- Modified the FastAPI app initialization to include proper metadata:
  - Title: "HackaVerse API"
  - Description: "Hackathon engine — agent /reward /logs"
  - Version: "v2.0"
  - Contact information: {"name": "Sejal & Team", "email": "youremail@example.com"}
- Added OpenAPI tags metadata for better organization
- Ensured proper inclusion of routers with tags

### 2. Updated src/schemas.py

- Added example values to the AgentRequest schema:
  - team_id: example="team_42"
  - submission_url: example="https://.../project.zip"
- Used Pydantic v2 compatible syntax for examples

### 3. Created src/routes.py

- Created router objects for agent, reward, and logs endpoints
- Added proper prefix and tags for each router
- Implemented placeholder routes that will be overridden by the main app endpoints

### 4. Updated README.md

- Added an "OpenAPI docs" section with:
  - Live docs URL placeholder
  - Sample cURL commands and expected HTTP responses
  - Instructions for local verification using the provided scripts

### 5. Created Scripts Directory

- Created scripts/check_docs.sh for Unix/Linux/Mac users
- Created scripts/check_docs.bat for Windows users
- Created verification scripts to test the implementation:
  - scripts/test_openapi.py
  - scripts/verify_routes.py
  - scripts/final_verification.py
  - scripts/test_curl_commands.py

## Verification Results

All requirements have been successfully implemented and verified:

✅ FastAPI app is created with proper metadata
✅ Routers are included with correct prefixes
✅ OpenAPI tags are properly defined and displayed
✅ Example responses are included in Pydantic schemas
✅ README.md contains the required OpenAPI documentation section
✅ Sample cURL commands are provided
✅ Local verification script is available

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are now properly documented in the OpenAPI specification:

- GET / - Root endpoint
- GET /ping - Health check endpoint
- GET /agent - Agent processing endpoint
- POST /agent - Agent processing endpoint
- GET /multi-agent - Multi-agent processing endpoint
- POST /reward - Reward calculation endpoint
- GET /logs - Log retrieval endpoint

## Tags

The API is organized with the following tags:

- agent: Agent operations for processing inputs and generating actions
- reward: Reward system for evaluating agent actions
- logs: Logging and monitoring endpoints

## Accessing Documentation

After starting the server with `uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000`:

1. Interactive documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
2. OpenAPI JSON specification: http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json
3. ReDoc documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

## Sample Usage

```bash
# Get docs (after deployment)
curl -s https://YOUR_URL/openapi.json | jq '.paths | keys'

# Call agent
curl -X POST https://YOUR_URL/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"team_id":"team_42","submission_url":"https://..." }'
```

## Local Verification

Run the provided verification script:

```bash
# Using the provided script (Unix/Linux/Mac)
chmod +x scripts/check_docs.sh
./scripts/check_docs.sh

# Using the provided script (Windows)
scripts\check_docs.bat

# Using Python verification script
python scripts/final_verification.py
```
