# BHIV Integration Checklist

This checklist confirms that all requirements for BHIV Core and BHIV Bucket integration have been completed.

## ✅ Requirement 1: Create folder and file structure

- [x] Create folder `src/integrations/`
- [x] Create file `src/integrations/bhiv_connectors.py`
- [x] Create `__init__.py` for package initialization

## ✅ Requirement 2: Implement connector functions

### send_to_core() function
- [x] Implement function with payload parameter
- [x] Add retry logic with max_retries parameter
- [x] Add backoff timing
- [x] Handle connection errors gracefully
- [x] Log failed attempts to `data/failed_core_sends.log`
- [x] Use `BHIV_CORE_URL` environment variable with default

### save_to_bucket() function
- [x] Implement function with payload and filename parameters
- [x] Save payload as JSON to specified file
- [x] Create directory structure if needed
- [x] Use `BHIV_BUCKET_DIR` environment variable with default
- [x] Return path to saved file

## ✅ Requirement 3: Integration into existing flow

### Executor integration
- [x] Import connectors in `src/executor.py`
- [x] Call `send_to_core()` with execution results
- [x] Call `save_to_bucket()` with execution results
- [x] Handle failures gracefully with logging

### Reward system integration
- [x] Import connectors in `src/reward.py`
- [x] Call `send_to_core()` with reward calculations
- [x] Call `save_to_bucket()` with reward calculations
- [x] Handle failures gracefully with logging

## ✅ Requirement 4: Environment variables

- [x] Add `BHIV_CORE_URL` to `.env.example`
- [x] Add `BHIV_BUCKET_DIR` to `.env.example`
- [x] Set appropriate defaults for both variables

## ✅ Requirement 5: Verification script

- [x] Create `scripts/test_bhiv_connectors.py`
- [x] Test `send_to_core()` function (demonstrates retry logic)
- [x] Test `save_to_bucket()` function (verifies data integrity)
- [x] Write output files for reviewer inspection
- [x] Commit output files for inspection

## ✅ Verification Results

### Test Execution
- [x] `save_to_bucket()` successfully saves data to `data/bucket/`
- [x] Data integrity verified through file content check
- [x] `send_to_core()` demonstrates retry logic with connection failures
- [x] Failed requests properly logged to `data/failed_core_sends.log`

### Output Files
- [x] `data/bucket/test_execution_*.json` - Sample saved execution data
- [x] `data/failed_core_sends.log` - Sample failed core send log

### Integration Verification
- [x] Connectors successfully imported in executor module
- [x] Connectors successfully imported in reward module
- [x] Integration points properly handle success and failure cases

## ✅ Additional Implementation Details

### Error Handling
- [x] Graceful handling of connection errors
- [x] Proper logging of all operations
- [x] Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- [x] Data integrity verification

### Code Quality
- [x] Proper documentation for all functions
- [x] Type hints for parameters and return values
- [x] Comprehensive logging
- [x] Clean and readable code structure

## ✅ Final Status

All requirements have been successfully implemented and verified. The BHIV Core and BHIV Bucket connectors are fully functional and integrated into the existing agent flow. The implementation is ready for deployment and can easily be swapped to use real endpoints when available.
