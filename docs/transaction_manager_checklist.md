# Transaction Manager Implementation Checklist

This checklist confirms that all requirements for making the flow atomic-ish have been completed.

## ✅ Requirement 1: Create transaction_manager.py

- [x] Create `src/transaction_manager.py` file
- [x] Implement `@retry` decorator with max_retries and backoff parameters
- [x] Implement [Transaction](file://c:\Users\91801\OneDrive\Documents\SEJAL%20HACKATHON\hackathon\src\transaction_manager.py#L46-L119) class with [add_step()](file://c:\Users\91801\OneDrive\Documents\SEJAL%20HACKATHON\hackathon\src\transaction_manager.py#L63-L72) and [commit()](file://c:\Users\91801\OneDrive\Documents\SEJAL%20HACKATHON\hackathon\src\transaction_manager.py#L74-L119) methods
- [x] Implement [TransactionError](file://c:\Users\91801\OneDrive\Documents\SEJAL%20HACKATHON\hackathon\src\transaction_manager.py#L43-L44) exception class

## ✅ Requirement 2: Implement core flow using the manager

- [x] Demonstrate core flow: submit → reasoning → reward → save
- [x] Show how to use transaction manager with existing components
- [x] Provide clear examples of usage patterns

## ✅ Requirement 3: Verification with failing step simulation

- [x] Create `tests/test_transaction_manager.py`
- [x] Simulate failing step (mock function that raises exception)
- [x] Verify `data/failed_transactions.json` has entry for failed transaction

## ✅ Verification Results

### Unit Tests
- [x] `test_retry_success` - ✅ PASSED
- [x] `test_retry_failure` - ✅ PASSED
- [x] `test_transaction_initialization` - ✅ PASSED
- [x] `test_add_step` - ✅ PASSED
- [x] `test_commit_success` - ✅ PASSED
- [x] `test_commit_failure_logging` - ✅ PASSED
- [x] `test_commit_partial_failure` - ✅ PASSED

### Transaction Flow
- [x] Successful transaction execution with 4 steps
- [x] Failed transaction properly logged to `data/failed_transactions.json`
- [x] Error information includes transaction ID and error message
- [x] Timestamp recorded for failed transactions

### Core Flow Implementation
- [x] Submit step executed correctly
- [x] Reasoning step executed correctly
- [x] Reward calculation step executed correctly
- [x] Save submission step executed correctly
- [x] All steps executed in correct order

### Error Handling
- [x] Failed transactions are logged with full error information
- [x] Failed transaction file is created if it doesn't exist
- [x] Data directory is created if it doesn't exist
- [x] Proper exception chaining for debugging

## ✅ Additional Implementation Details

### Retry Decorator
- [x] Configurable maximum retries (default 3)
- [x] Exponential backoff (default 1 second)
- [x] Proper logging of retry attempts
- [x] Correct exception propagation

### Transaction Class
- [x] Unique transaction ID support
- [x] Sequential step execution
- [x] Immediate failure on any step error
- [x] Comprehensive logging
- [x] Clean error messages

### Code Quality
- [x] Proper documentation for all functions
- [x] Type hints for parameters and return values
- [x] Comprehensive logging
- [x] Clean and readable code structure

### Testing
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Edge case testing
- [x] Cleanup of test files after testing
- [x] Verification of error logging

## ✅ Final Status

All requirements have been successfully implemented and verified. The transaction manager is fully functional, providing atomic transaction handling with retry logic for critical operations. The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests that verify failed transactions are properly logged to `data/failed_transactions.json`.
